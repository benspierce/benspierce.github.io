            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a PhD Candidate in the Learning Sciences and Policy Program at the University of Pittsburgh, working on advancing our understanding of how to measure student cognitive development at the Learning Research & Development Center. My research focuses on measurement issues in literacy education, particularly how to measure student development in reasoning ability and analytic writing skill. In my work I focus on applying established psychometric techniques such as Item Response Theory to identify new ways to measure student development and teacher instructional quality. As a former teacher, I also have a focus on practical policy solutions that better measurements can help researcher and practitioners identify.</p>

                <h3>Multi-Dimensional Performance Analysis of Large Language Models for Classroom Discussion Assessment</h3>
                <p>Nhat Tran, Benjamin Pierce, Diane Litman, Richard Correnti, & Lindsay Clare Matsumura, <i>Journal of Educational Data Mining</i> (forthcoming 2025)</p>
                <p>In this paper I collaborate with colleagues to test the performance of two generative LLMs on assessing the quality of classroom instruction. My primary contribution to this paper was to develop a multilevel model to test LLM performance against that of human raters, as well as writing a validity argument and a literature review and managing the team's responses to reviewer comments.</p>

                <h3>Teacher Attention and Improving Student Reasoning in Classroom Text Discussions</h3>
                <p>Benjamin Pierce, Richard Correnti, <i>Proceedings of the 18th International Conference of the Learning Sciences</i> (2024)</p>
                <p>This paper argues for the identification of an important dimension of instructional quality in literacy education, teacher attention to metacognitive opportunities. This paper lays the qualitative groundwork for further psychometric work currently in progress.</p>

                <h3>Multi-Dimensional Performance Analysis of Large Language Models for Classroom Discussion Assessment</h3>

                <p>In this paper I collaborate with colleagues to test the performance of a pre-trained LLM on assessing the quality of classroom instruction. My primary contribution to this paper was to develop a multilevel model to test LLM performance against that of human raters, as well as writing a validity argument and a literature review.</p>
