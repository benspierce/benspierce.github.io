            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a PhD Candidate in the Learning Sciences and Policy Program at the University of Pittsburgh, working on advancing our understanding of how to measure student cognitive development at the Learning Research & Development Center. My research focuses on measurement issues in literacy education, particularly how to measure student development in reasoning ability and analytic writing skill. In my work I focus on applying established psychometric techniques such as Item Response Theory to identify new ways to measure student development and teacher instructional quality. As a former teacher, I also have a focus on practical policy solutions that better measurements can help researchers and practitioners identify.</p>
            <p>Before beginning my current research, I taught philosophy and analytic writing for several years at the University of Chicago and Auburn University. I maintain an ongoing interest in philosophical topics, particularly the philosophy of action and the philosophical significance of modern and contemporary art. I am an avid backcountry hiker and live with my two cats, Morrigan and Dewey.</p>

            <h2>Research Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Scalable Sources of Evidence for Student Reasoning Development
                    <ul>
                        <li>Research into student reasoning and argumentation is limited by problems of scale. Small-scale interventions and case studies can be  deeply illuminating, but have limited power to license generalizable inferences and can be impractical to implement for larger groups of students. Large-scale studies often achieve scale by sacrificing the complexity and detail of the constructs measured, which introduce threats to validity.</li>
                        <li>Using Item Response Theory, we take advantage of a large dataset of instructional logs (>2.3 million observations) to develop a novel measure of opportunities to develop reasoning ability, and use statistical analysis to determine construct validity and assess change in construct incidence over time.</li>
                        <li>Once complete, the project will shed light on trends and disparities in the students' classroom opportunities to develop their reasoning skill, drawing attention to a vital but overlooked dimension of instructional quality.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Developing Argumentation Skills in Middle School: Evidence from a Multilevel Growth Analysis
                    <ul>
                        <li>This project examines data from a randomized controlled trial of an argument writing curriculum intervention in an urban school district. Here we answer the question: when students improve their reasoning ability, how does that improvement happen over time and under what conditions?</li>
                        <li>We examine longitudinal trends by considering holistic measures of argument writing ability as well as specific reasoning skills. Exploiting differences in curriculum implementation over time, we find evidence for the importance of specific scaffolds for the development of student argument writing ability, and find strong evidence that draft revision gives students important opportunities to develop argument writing elements that are not present otherwise.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Automated Assessment of Classroom Discussion Quality
                    <ul>
                        <li>Quality of classroom discussions has been linked to student cognitive development across a variety of dimensions. But classroom discussion quality is hard to assess at scale due to the complexity of transcript analysis, limiting research that could help teachers understand how to improve their discussion facilitation and making it hard for them to receive useful formative feedback.</li>
                        <li>In this project, we assess the ability of several different large language models (pre-trained and generative) to rate the instructional quality of classroom discussions using an existing, validated measure of instructional quality. We find that the inter-rater reliability of these models with human raters is comparable to the inter-rater reliability among human raters, and that we can reproduce research inferences made with human-generated scores using model-generated scores. This project demonstrates the promise of large language models as research tools for education scientists and formative feedback platforms for teachers.</li>

                <p>In this paper I collaborate with colleagues to test the performance of two generative LLMs on assessing the quality of classroom instruction. My primary contribution to this paper was to develop a multilevel model to test LLM performance against that of human raters, as well as writing a validity argument and a literature review and managing the team's responses to reviewer comments.</p>

                <p>This paper argues for the identification of an important dimension of instructional quality in literacy education, teacher attention to metacognitive opportunities. This paper lays the qualitative groundwork for further psychometric work currently in progress.</p>
